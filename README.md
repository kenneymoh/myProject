Start by creating a basic HTML page with the appropriate structure, including the <html>, <head>, and <body> elements.

Use CSS to style the page, including setting the font, colors, and layout. You can use a CSS framework like Bootstrap or create your own styles.

Add the necessary HTML elements to display the weather data. This may include elements like <h1> for the title, <p> for the current temperature, and <img> for an icon representing the current conditions.

Use JavaScript or a similar language to fetch the weather data from a weather API. This will typically involve making an HTTP request to the API and then parsing the JSON response to extract the relevant data.

Use the weather data to update the HTML elements on the page, showing the current temperature, conditions, and other relevant information.

Test the app to ensure that it works as expected and that the weather data is displayed correctly.

Overall, creating a weather app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a relatively straightforward process that can be accomplished by following these steps.
